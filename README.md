# 3D Printing 101 (Interactive eLearning Module)

This repository contains an interactive **3D Printing 101** eLearning course, originally authored with *Lectora / Trivantis*. The module is exported as static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media assets, and published through **GitHub Pages**.

## 🔗 Live Demo
You can view the course online here:  
👉 [3D Printing 101 on GitHub Pages](https://dgutensohn03.github.io/3D_Printing/)

## 📂 Project Structure
- **HTML files** – Course pages (`a001_intro_0.0_welcome.html`, etc.)  
- **images/** – UI icons, navigation buttons, and graphics  
- **js/** – JavaScript runtime (`trivantis-button.js`, etc.) powering course interactivity  
- **css/** – Course stylesheets and theme definitions  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Lectora Inspire / Trivantis** – Authoring tool used to build the original eLearning module  
- **JavaScript** – Page interactivity, navigation, and button actions  
- **HTML5 + CSS3** – Course layout and design  
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting and deployment of the static course site  

## 🚀 Deployment
This project is deployed via **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch.  
To prevent Jekyll from ignoring files that start with an underscore (`_`), the repo uses a `.nojekyll` file at the root.  

## 📖 About
This project demonstrates how traditional eLearning content can be hosted outside of an LMS environment for demo, testing, and portfolio purposes. It preserves all original navigation and multimedia functionality, including buttons, videos, and progress tracking (client-side only).
